# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers.  Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up.  Please consider joining the

# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration

# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
